# Robot and Process Mining 
The methodology aims to support the robotic developer in the automatic extraction of robotic event logs from the execution of a robotic system and analyze them through process mining.

The methodology has been designed to foster the application of process mining and the development of techniques suitable for robotic systems. It allows the system designer to specify tags in the source code and transform them into events to be inserted into the log. The generated event logs are enriched with multi-perspective information (as space, communication, and battery), thus defining a multi-perspective event log, suitable for the application of process mining techniques.

## Submodules
- **robot_data_preparation**: contains the scripts enabling the processing of robotic event logs.

- **robotrace**: contains the tool enabling multi-perspective analysis of robotic systems using process mining and visual analytics.
